# Simple Web Server in Go

This project is a simple web server written in Go. It serves as a starting point in my journey to becoming a cloud developer, where I aim to leverage Go and cloud technologies to build scalable and efficient applications.

## Features

- Basic HTTP server setup using Go's built-in `net/http` package.
- Serve static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Minimalistic routing for handling different HTTP endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Usage

- Visit `http://localhost:8081` in your web browser to see the default homepage.
- Add your own HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to the `static` directory to serve custom content.
- Customize routing and add more endpoints as needed in `main.go`.

## Roadmap

As I progress in my journey to becoming a cloud developer, here are some areas I plan to explore and integrate into this project:

- Containerization with Docker
- Deployment to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
- Integration with cloud-native services for scalability, reliability, and observability
